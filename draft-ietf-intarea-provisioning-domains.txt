             Discovering Provisioning Domain Names and Data
               draft-ietf-intarea-provisioning-domains-04

Abstract

   An increasing number of hosts access the Internet via multiple
   interfaces or, in IPv6 multi-homed networks, via multiple IPv6 prefix
   configurations context.

   This document describes a way for hosts to identify such contexts,
   called Provisioning Domains (PvDs), where Fully Qualified Domain
   Names (FQDNs) act as PvD identifiers.  Those identifiers are
   advertised in a new Router Advertisement (RA) option and, when
   present, are associated with the set of information included within
   the RA.

   Based on this FQDN, hosts can retrieve additional information about
   their network access characteristics via an HTTP over TLS query.
   This allows applications to select which Provisioning Domains to use
   as well as to provide configuration parameters to the transport layer
   and above.

1.  Introduction

   It has become very common in modern networks for hosts to access the
   internet through different network interfaces, tunnels, or next-hop
   routers.  To describe the set of network configurations associated
   with each access method, the concept of Provisioning Domain (PvD) was
   defined in [RFC7556].

   This document specifies a way to identify PvDs with Fully Qualified
   Domain Names (FQDN), called PvD IDs.  Those identifiers are
   advertised in a new Router Advertisement (RA) [RFC4861] option called
   the PvD ID Router Advertisement option which, when present,
   associates the PvD ID with all the information present in the Router
   Advertisement as well as any configuration object, such as addresses,
   deriving from it.  The PVD ID Router Advertisement option may also
   contain a set of other RA options.  Since such options are only
   considered by hosts implementing this specification, network
   operators may configure hosts that are 'PvD-aware' with PvDs that are
   ignored by other hosts.

   Since PvD IDs are used to identify different ways to access the
   internet, multiple PvDs (with different PvD IDs) could be provisioned
   on a single host interface.  Similarly, the same PvD ID could be used
   on different interfaces of a host in order to inform that those PvDs
   ultimately provide identical services.

   This document also introduces a way for hosts to retrieve additional
   information related to a specific PvD by means of an HTTP over TLS
   query using an URI derived from the PvD ID.  The retrieved JSON
   object contains additional information that would typically be
   considered unfit, or too large, to be directly included in the Router
   Advertisement, but might be considered useful to the applications, or
   even sometimes users, when choosing which PvD should be used.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   In addition, this document uses the following terminology:

   Provisioning Domain (PvD):   A set of network configuration
      information; for more information, see [RFC7556].

   PvD ID:   A Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) used to identify a
      PvD.

   Explicit PvD:   A PvD uniquely identified with a PvD ID.  For more
      information, see [RFC7556].

   Implicit PvD:   A PvD that, in the absence of a PvD ID, is identified
      by the host interface to which it is attached and the address of
      the advertising router.  See also [RFC7556].

   PvD-aware host  A host that supports the association of network
      configuration information into PvDs and the use of these PvDs.
      Also named PvD-aware node in [RFC7556].

3.  Provisioning Domain Identification using Router Advertisements

   Explicit PvDs are identified by a PvD ID.  The PvD ID is a Fully
   Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) which MUST belong to the network
   operator in order to avoid naming collisions.  The same PvD ID MAY be
   used in several access networks when they ultimately provide
   identical services (e.g., in all home networks subscribed to the same
   service); else, the PvD ID MUST be different to follow section 2.4 of
   [RFC7556].

3.1.  PvD ID Option for Router Advertisements

   This document introduces a Router Advertisement (RA) option called
   PvD option.  It is used to convey the FQDN identifying a given PvD
   (see Figure 1), bind the PvD ID with configuration information
   received over DHCPv4 (see Section 3.4.2), enable the use of HTTP over
   TLS to retrieve the PvD Additional Information JSON object (see
   Section 4), as well as contain any other RA options which would
   otherwise be valid in the RA.

3.2.  Router Behavior

   A router MAY send RAs containing one PvD option, but MUST NOT include
   more than one PvD option in each RA.  In particular, the PvD option
   MUST NOT contain further PvD options.

   The PvD Option MAY contain zero, one, or more RA options which would
   otherwise be valid as part of the same RA.  Such options are
   processed by PvD-aware hosts, while ignored by others.

   In order to provide multiple different PvDs, a router MUST send
   multiple RAs.  Different explicit PvDs MAY be advertised with RAs
   using the same IPv6 source address; but different implicit PvDs,
   advertised by different RAs, MUST use different link-local addresses
   because these implicit PvDs are identified by the source addresses of
   the RAs.

   As specified in [RFC4861], when the set of options causes the size of
   an advertisement to exceed the link MTU, multiple router
   advertisements can be sent, each containing a subset of the options.
   In such cases, the PvD option header (i.e., all fields except the

Internet-Draft            Provisioning Domains                 June 2018


   'Options' field) MUST be repeated in all the transmitted RAs.  The
   options within the 'Options' field, MAY be transmitted only once,
   included in one of the transmitted PvD options.

3.3.  Non-PvD-aware Host Behavior

   As the PvD Option has a new option code, non-PvD-aware hosts will
   simply ignore the PvD Option and all the options it contains.  This
   ensure the backward compatibility required in section 3.3 of
   [RFC7556].  This behavior allows for a mixed-mode network with a mix
   of PvD-aware and non-PvD-aware hosts coexist.

3.4.  PvD-aware Host Behavior

   Hosts MUST associate received RAs and included configuration
   information (e.g., Router Valid Lifetime, Prefix Information
   [RFC4861], Recursive DNS Server [RFC8106], Routing Information
   [RFC4191] options) with the explicit PvD identified by the first PvD
   Option present in the received RA, if any, or with the implicit PvD
   identified by the host interface and the source address of the
   received RA otherwise.

   In case multiple PvD options are found in a given RA, hosts MUST
   ignore all but the first PvD option.

   If a host receives PvD options flags that it does not recognize
   (currently in the Reserved field), it MUST ignore these flags.

   Similarly, hosts MUST associate all network configuration objects
   (e.g., default routers, addresses, more specific routes, DNS
   Recursive Resolvers) with the PvD associated with the RA which last
   updated the object.  For example, addresses that are generated using
   a received Prefix Information option (PIO) are associated with the
   PvD of the last received RA which included the given PIO.

   PvD IDs MUST be compared in a case-insensitive manner (i.e., A=a),
   assuming ASCII with zero parity while non-alphabetic codes must match
   exactly (see also Section 3.1 of [RFC1035]).  For example,
   "pvd.example.com." or "PvD.Example.coM." would refer to the same PvD.

   While resolving names, executing the default address selection
   algorithm [RFC6724] or executing the default router selection
   algorithm when forwarding packets ([RFC2461], [RFC4191] and
   [RFC8028]), hosts MAY consider only the configuration associated with
   an arbitrary set of PvDs.

   For example, a host MAY associate a given process with a specific
   PvD, or a specific set of PvDs, while associating another process

Internet-Draft            Provisioning Domains                 June 2018


   with another PvD.  A PvD-aware application might also be able to
   select, on a per-connection basis, which PvDs should be used.  In
   particular, constrained devices such as small battery operated
   devices (e.g.  IoT), or devices with limited CPU or memory resources
   may purposefully use a single PvD while ignoring some received RAs
   containing different PvD IDs.

   The way an application expresses its desire to use a given PvD, or a
   set of PvDs, or the way this selection is enforced, is out of the
   scope of this document.  Useful insights about these considerations
   can be found in [I-D.kline-mif-mpvd-api-reqs].

3.4.1.  DHCPv6 configuration association

   When a host retrieves configuration elements using DHCPv6 (e.g.,
   addresses or DNS recursive resolvers), they MUST be associated with
   the explicit or implicit PvD of the RA received on the same
   interface, sent from the same LLA, and with the O-flag or M-flag set
   [RFC4861].  If no such PvD is found, or whenever multiple different
   PvDs are found, the host behavior is unspecified.

   This process requires hosts to keep track of received RAs, associated
   PvD IDs, and routers LLA; it also assumes that the router either acts
   as a DHCPv6 server or relay and uses the same LLA for DHCPv6 and RA
   traffic (which may not be the case when the router uses VRRP to send
   its RA).

3.4.2.  DHCPv4 configuration association

   When a host retrieves configuration elements from DHCPv4, they MUST
   be associated with the explicit PvD received on the same interface,
   whose PVD Options L-flag is set and, in the case of a non point-to-
   point link, using the same datalink address.  If no such PvD is
   found, or whenever multiple different PvDs are found, the
   configuration elements coming from DHCPv4 MUST be associated with the
   implicit PvD identified by the interface on which the DHCPv4
   transaction happened.  The case of multiple explicit PvD for an IPv4
   interface is undefined.

3.4.3.  Connection Sharing by the Host

   The situation when a host shares connectivity from an upstream
   interface (e.g. cellular) to a downstream interface (e.g.  WiFi) is
   known as 'tethering'.  Techniques such as ND-proxy [RFC4389], 64share
   [RFC7278] or prefix delegation (e.g. using DHCPv6-PD [RFC8415]) may
   be used for that purpose.

   Whenever the RAs received from the upstream interface contain a PVD
   RA option, hosts that are sharing connectivity SHOULD include a PVD
   Option within the RAs sent downstream with:

      The same PVD-ID FQDN.

      The same H-bit, Delay and Sequence Number values.

      The L bit set whenever the host is sharing IPv4 connectivity
      received from the same upstream interface.

      The bits from the Reserved field set to 0.

   The values of the R-bit, Router Advertisement message header and
   Options field depend on whether the connectivity should be shared
   only with PvD-aware hosts or not (see Section 3.2).  In particular,
   all options received within the upstream PvD option and included in
   the downstream RA SHOULD be included in the downstream PvD option.

3.4.4.  Usage of DNS Servers

   PvD-aware hosts can be provisioned with recursive DNS servers via RA
   options passed within an explicit PvD, via RA options associated with
   an implicit PvD, via DHCPv6 or DHCPv4, or from some other
   provisioning mechanism that creates an implicit PvD (such as a VPN).
   In all of these cases, the DNS server addresses SHOULD be strongly
   associated with the corresponding PvD.  Specificially, queries sent
   to a configured recursive DNS server SHOULD be sent from a local IP
   address that belongs to the matching PvD.  Answers received from the
   DNS server SHOULD only be used on the same PvD.

   Maintaining the correct usage of DNS within PvDs avoids various
   practical errors, such as:

      A PvD associated with a VPN or otherwise private network may
      provide DNS answers that contain addresses inaccessible over
      another PvD.

      A PvD that uses a NAT64 [RFC6146] and DNS64 [RFC6147] will
      synthesize IPv6 addresses in DNS answers that are not globally
      routable, and cannot be used on other PvDs.  Conversely, an IPv4
      address resolved via DNS on another PvD cannot be directly used on
      a NAT64 network without the host synthesizing an IPv6 address.

4.  Provisioning Domain Additional Information

   Additional information about the network characteristics can be
   retrieved based on the PvD ID.  This set of information is called PvD
   Additional Information, and is encoded as a JSON object [RFC7159].

   The purpose of this additional set of information is to securely
   provide additional information to applications about the connectivity
   that is provided using a given interface and source address pair.  It
   typically includes data that would be considered too large, or not
   critical enough, to be provided within an RA option.  The information
   contained in this object MAY be used by the operating system, network
   libraries, applications, or users, in order to decide which set of
   PvDs should be used for which connection, as described in
   Section 3.4.

4.1.  Retrieving the PvD Additional Information

   When the H-flag of the PvD Option is set, hosts MAY attempt to
   retrieve the PvD Additional Information associated with a given PvD
   by performing an HTTP over TLS [RFC2818] GET query to https://<PvD-
   ID>/.well-known/pvd [RFC5785].  Inversely, hosts MUST NOT do so
   whenever the H-flag is not set.

   Note that the DNS name resolution of the PvD ID, the PKI checks as
   well as the actual query MUST be performed using the considered PvD.
   In other words, the name resolution, PKI checks, source address
   selection, as well as the next-hop router selection MUST be performed
   while using exclusively the set of configuration information attached
   with the PvD, as defined in Section 3.4.  In some cases, it may
   therefore be necessary to wait for an address to be available for use
   (e.g., once the Duplicate Address Detection or DHCPv6 processes are
   complete) before initiating the HTTP over TLS query.  If the host has
   a temporary address per [RFC4941] in this PvD, then hosts SHOULD use
   a temporary address to fetch the PvD Additional Information and
   SHOULD deprecate the used temporary address and generate a new
   temporary address afterward.

   If the HTTP status of the answer is greater than or equal to 400 the
   host MUST abandon and consider that there is no additional PvD
   information.  If the HTTP status of the answer is between 300 and
   399, inclusive, it MUST follow the redirection(s).  If the HTTP
   status of the answer is between 200 and 299, inclusive, the host MAY
   get a file containing a single JSON object.  When a JSON object could
   not be retrieved, an error message SHOULD be logged and/or displayed
   in a rate-limited fashion.





Pfister, et al.         Expires December 6, 2018               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft            Provisioning Domains                 June 2018


   After retrieval of the PvD Additional Information, hosts MUST keep
   track of the Sequence Number value received in subsequent RAs
   including the same PvD ID.  In case the new value is greater than the
   value that was observed when the PvD Additional Information object
   was retrieved (using serial number arithmetic comparisons [RFC1982]),
   or whenever the validity time included in the PVD Additional
   Information JSON object is expired, hosts MUST either perform a new
   query and retrieve a new version of the object, or, failing that,
   deprecate the object and stop using the additional information
   provided in the JSON object.

   Hosts retrieving a new PvD Additional Information object MUST check
   for the presence and validity of the mandatory fields specified in
   Section 4.3.  A retrieved object including an expiration time that is
   already past or missing a mandatory element MUST be ignored.

   In order to avoid synchronized queries toward the server hosting the
   PvD Additional Information when an object expires, object updates are
   delayed by a randomized backoff time.

      When a host performs an object update after it detected a change
      in the PvD Option Sequence number, it MUST delay the query by a
      random time between zero and 2**(Delay * 2) milliseconds, where
      'Delay' corresponds to the 4 bits long unsigned integer in the
      last received PvD Option.

      When a host last retrieved an object at time A including a
      validity time B, and is configured to keep the object up to date,
      it MUST perform the update at a uniformly random time in the
      interval [(B-A)/2,B].

   In the example Figure 2, the delay field value is 5, this means that
   host MUST delay the query by a random number between 0 and 2**(5 * 2)
   milliseconds, i.e., between 0 and 1024 milliseconds.

   Since the 'Delay' value is directly within the PvD Option rather than
   the object itself, an operator may perform a push-based update by
   incrementing the Sequence value while changing the Delay value
   depending on the criticality of the update and its PvD Additional
   Information servers capacity.

   The PvD Additional Information object includes a set of IPv6 prefixes
   (under the key "prefixes") which MUST be checked against all the
   Prefix Information Options advertised in the RA.  If any of the
   prefixes included in the PIO is not covered by at least one of the
   listed prefixes, the PvD associated with the tested prefix MUST be
   considered unsafe and MUST NOT be used.  While this does not prevent

   a malicious network provider, it does complicate some attack
   scenarios, and may help detecting misconfiguration.

4.2.  Operational Consideration to Providing the PvD Additional
      Information

   Whenever the H-flag is set in the PvD Option, a valid PvD Additional
   Information object MUST be made available to all hosts receiving the
   RA by the network operator.  In particular, when a captive portal is
   present, hosts MUST still be allowed to perform DNS, PKI and HTTP
   over TLS operations related to the retrieval of the object, even
   before logging into the captive portal.

   Routers MAY increment the PVD Option Sequence number in order to
   inform host that a new PvD Additional Information object is available
   and should be retrieved.

   The server providing the JSON files SHOULD also check whether the
   client address is part of the prefixes listed into the additional
   information and SHOULD return a 403 response code if there is no
   match.

4.3.  PvD Additional Information Format

   The PvD Additional Information is a JSON object.

   The following table presents the mandatory keys which MUST be
   included in the object:

   +----------+-----------------+-------------+------------------------+
   | JSON key | Description     | Type        | Example                |

   |          | object is not   |             |                        |
   |          | valid           |             |                        |

   |          | for this PVD    |             |                        |
   +----------+-----------------+-------------+------------------------+

   A retrieved object which does not include a valid string associated
   with the "name" key at the root of the object, or a valid date
   associated with the "expires" key, also at the root of the object,
   MUST be ignored.  In such cases, an error message SHOULD be logged

   +---------------+-----------------+---------+-----------------------+

   It is worth noting that the JSON format allows for extensions.
   Whenever an unknown key is encountered, it MUST be ignored along with
   its associated elements.

4.3.1.  Private Extensions

   JSON keys starting with "x-" are reserved for private use and can be
   utilized to provide information that is specific to vendor, user or
   enterprise.  It is RECOMMENDED to use one of the patterns "x-FQDN-
   KEY" or "x-PEN-KEY" where FQDN is a fully qualified domain name or
   PEN is a private enterprise number [PEN] under control of the author
   of the extension to avoid collisions.

4.3.2.  Example

   Here are two examples based on the keys defined in this section.

     "prefixes": ["2001:db8:1::/48", "2001:db8:4::/48"],
   }

4.4.  Detecting misconfiguration and misuse

   When a host retrieves the PvD Additional Information, it MUST verify
   that the TLS server certificate is valid for the performed request
   (e.g., that the Subject Name is equal to the PvD ID expressed as an
   FQDN).  This authentication creates a secure binding between the
   information provided by the trusted Router Advertisement, and the
   HTTPS server.  However, this does not mean the Advertising Router and
   the PvD server belong to the same entity.

   Hosts MUST verify that all prefixes in the RA PIO are covered by a
   prefix from the PvD Additional Information.  An adversarial router
   willing to fake the use of a given explicit PvD, without any access
   to the actual PvD Additional Information, would need to perform NAT66
   in order to circumvent this check.

   It is also RECOMMENDED that the HTTPS server checks the IPv6 source
   addresses of incoming connections (see Section 4.1).  This check give
   reasonable assurance that neither NPTv6 [RFC6296] nor NAT66 were used
   and restricts the information to the valid network users.

   Note that this check cannot be performed when the HTTPS query is
   performed over IPv4.  Therefore, the PvD ID FQDN SHOULD NOT have a
   DNS A record whenever all hosts using the given PvD have IPv6
   connectivity.

5.  Operational Considerations

   This section describes some use cases of PvD.  For the sake of
   simplicity, the RA messages will not be described in the usual ASCII
   art but rather in an indented list.  For example, a RA message
   containing some options and a PvD option that also contains other
   options will be described as:

   o  RA Header: router lifetime = 6000

   o  Prefix Information Option: length = 4, prefix = 2001:db8:cafe::/64

   o  PvD Option header: length = 3 + 5 + 4 , PvD ID FQDN =
      example.org., R-flag = 0 (actual length of the header with padding
      24 bytes = 3 * 8 bytes)

      *  Recursive DNS Server: length = 5, addresses=
         [2001:db8:cafe::53, 2001:db8:f00d::53]

      *  Prefix Information Option: length = 4, prefix =
         2001:db8:f00d::/64

   It is expected that for some years, networks will have a mixed
   environment of PvD-aware hosts and non-PvD-aware hosts.  If there is
   a need to give specific information to PvD-aware hosts only, then it
   is recommended to send TWO RA messages: one for each class of hosts.
   For example, here is the RA for non-PvD-aware hosts:

   o  RA Header: router lifetime = 6000 (non-PvD-aware hosts will use
      this router as a default router)

   o  Prefix Information Option: length = 4, prefix = 2001:db8:cafe::/64

   o  Recursive DNS Server Option: length = 3, addresses=
      [2001:db8:cafe::53]

   o  PvD Option header: length = 3 + 2, PvD ID FQDN = foo.example.org.,
      R-flag = 1 (actual length of the header 24 bytes = 3 * 8 bytes)

      *  RA Header: router lifetime = 0 (PvD-aware hosts will not use
         this router as a default router), implicit length = 2

   And here is a RA example for PvD-aware hosts:

   o  RA Header: router lifetime = 0 (non-PvD-aware hosts will not use
      this router as a default router)

   o  PvD Option header: length = 3 + 2 + 4 + 3, PvD ID FQDN =
      example.org., R-flag = 1 (actual length of the header 24 bytes = 3
      * 8 bytes)

      *  RA Header: router lifetime = 1600 (PvD-aware hosts will use
         this router as a default router), implicit length = 2

      *  Prefix Information Option: length = 4, prefix =
         2001:db8:f00d::/64

      *  Recursive DNS Server Option: length = 3, addresses=
         [2001:db8:f00d::53]

   In the above example, non-PvD-aware hosts will only use the first RA
   sent from their default router and using the 2001:db8:cafe::/64
   prefix.  PvD-aware hosts will autonomously configure addresses from
   both PIOs, but will only use the source address in 2001:db8:f00d::/64
   to communicate past the first hop router since only the router
   sending the second RA will be used as default router; similarly, they
   will use the DNS server 2001:db8:f00d::53 when communicating with
   this adress.

6.  Security Considerations

   Although some solutions such as IPsec or SeND [RFC3971] can be used
   in order to secure the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol, in practice
   actual deployments largely rely on link layer or physical layer
   security mechanisms (e.g. 802.1x [IEEE8021X]) in conjunction with RA
   Guard [RFC6105].

   This specification does not improve the Neighbor Discovery Protocol
   security model, but extends the purely link-local trust relationship
   between the host and the default routers with HTTP over TLS
   communications which servers are authenticated as rightful owners of
   the FQDN received within the trusted PvD ID RA option.

   It must be noted that Section 4.4 of this document only provides
   reasonable assurance against misconfiguration but does not prevent an
   hostile network access provider to advertize wrong information that
   could lead applications or hosts to select an hostile PvD.  Users
   should always apply caution when connecting to an unknown network.

7.  Privacy Considerations

   Retrieval of the PvD Additional Information over HTTPS requires early
   communications between the connecting host and a server which may be
   located further than the first hop router.  Although this server is
   likely to be located within the same administrative domain as the
   default router, this property can't be ensured.  Therefore, hosts
   willing to retrieve the PvD Additional Information before using it
   without leaking identity information, SHOULD make use of an IPv6
   Privacy Address and SHOULD NOT include any privacy sensitive data,
   such as User Agent header or HTTP cookie, while performing the HTTP
   over TLS query.

   From a privacy perspective, retrieving the PvD Additional Information
   is not different from establishing a first connection to a remote
   server, or even performing a single DNS lookup.  For example, most



Pfister, et al.         Expires December 6, 2018               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft            Provisioning Domains                 June 2018


   operating systems already perform early queries to well known web
   sites, such as http://captive.example.com/hotspot-detect.html, in
   order to detect the presence of a captive portal.

   There may be some cases where hosts, for privacy reasons, should
   refrain from accessing servers that are located outside a certain
   network boundary.  In practice, this could be implemented as a
   whitelist of 'trusted' FQDNs and/or IP prefixes that the host is
   allowed to communicate with.  In such scenarios, the host SHOULD
   check that the provided PvD ID, as well as the IP address that it
   resolves into, are part of the allowed whitelist.

8.  IANA Considerations

   Upon publication of this document, IANA is asked to remove the
   'reclaimable' tag off the value 21 for the PvD option (from the IPv6
   Neighbor Discovery Option Formats registry).

   IANA is asked to assign the value "pvd" from the Well-Known URIs
   registry.

8.1.  Additional Information PvD Keys Registry

   IANA is asked to create and maintain a new registry called
   "Additional Information PvD Keys", which will reserve JSON keys for
   use in PvD additional information.  The initial contents of this
   registry are given in Section 4.3.

   New assignments for Additional Information PvD Keys Registry will be
   administered by IANA through Expert Review RFC8126 [RFC8126].

8.2.  PvD Option Flags Registry

   IANA is also asked to create and maintain a new registry entitled
   "PvD Option Flags" reserving bit positions from 0 to 15 to be used in
   the PvD option bitmask.  Bit position 0, 1 and 2 are reserved by this
   document (as specified in Figure 1).  Future assignments require
   Standards Action RFC8126 [RFC8126], via a Standards Track RFC
   document.

Appendix A.  Changelog

   Note to RFC Editors: Remove this section before publication.

A.1.  Version 00

   Initial version of the draft.  Edited by Basile Bruneau + Eric Vyncke
   and based on Basile's work.

A.2.  Version 01

   Major rewrite intended to focus on the the retained solution based on
   corridors, online, and WG discussions.  Edited by Pierre Pfister.
   The following list only includes major changes.

      PvD ID is an FQDN retrieved using a single RA option.  This option
      contains a sequence number for push-based updates, a new H-flag,
      and a L-flag in order to link the PvD with the IPv4 DHCP server.

      A lifetime is included in the PvD ID option.

      Detailed Hosts and Routers specifications.

      Additional Information is retrieved using HTTP-over-TLS when the
      PvD ID Option H-flag is set.  Retrieving the object is optional.

      The PvD Additional Information object includes a validity date.

      DNS-based approach is removed as well as the DNS-based encoding of
      the PvD Additional Information.

      Major cut in the list of proposed JSON keys.  This document may be
      extended later if need be.

      Monetary discussion is moved to the appendix.

Internet-Draft            Provisioning Domains                 June 2018


      Clarification about the 'prefixes' contained in the additional
      information.

      Clarification about the processing of DHCPv6.

A.3.  Version 02

      The FQDN is now encoded with ASCII format (instead of DNS binary)
      in the RA option.

      The PvD ID option lifetime is removed from the object.

      Use well known URI "https://<PvD-ID>/.well-known/pvd"

      Reference RFC3339 for JSON timestamp format.

      The PvD ID Sequence field has been extended to 16 bits.

      Modified host behavior for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6.

      Removed IKEv2 section.

      Removed mention of RFC7710 Captive Portal option.  A new I.D.
      will be proposed to address the captive portal use case.

A.4.  WG Document version 00

      Document has been accepted as INTAREA working group document

      IANA considerations follow RFC8126 [RFC8126]

      PvD ID FQDN is encoded as per RFC 1035 [RFC1035]

      PvD ID FQDN is prepended by a one-byte length field

      Marcus Keane added as co-author

      dnsZones key is added back

      draft of a privacy consideration section and added that a
      temporary address should be used to retrieve the PvD additional
      information

      per Bob Hinden's request: the document is now aiming at standard
      track and security considerations have been moved to the main
      section

Internet-Draft            Provisioning Domains                 June 2018


A.5.  WG Document version 01

      Removing references to 'metered' and 'characteristics' keys.
      Those may be in scope of the PvD work, but this document will
      focus on essential parts only.

      Removing appendix section regarding link quality and billing
      information.

      The PvD RA Option may now contain other RA options such that PvD-
      aware hosts may receive configuration information otherwise
      invisible to non-PvD-aware hosts.

      Clarify that the additional PvD Additional Information is not
      intended to modify host's networking stack behavior, but rather
      provide information to the Application, used to select which PvDs
      must be used and provide configuration parameters to the transport
      layer.

      The RA option padding is used to increase the option size to the
      next 64 (was 32) bits boundary.

      Better detail the Security model and Privacy considerations.

A.6.  WG Document version 02

      Use the IANA value of 21 in the text and update the IANA
      considerations section accordingly

      add the Delay field to avoid the thundering herd effect

      add Wenqin Shao as author

      keep the 1 PvD per RA model

      changed the intro (per Zhen Cao) "when choosing which PvD and
      transport should be used" => "when choosing which PvD should be
      used"

      rename A-flag in R-flag to avoid A-flag of PIO

      use the wording "PvD Option", removing the ID token as it is now a
      container with more then just an ID, removing 'RA' in the option
      name to be consistent with other IANA NDP option

      use "non-PvD-aware" rather than "PvD-ignorant"

Internet-Draft            Provisioning Domains                 June 2018


      added more reference to RFC 7556 (notably for PvD being globally
      unique, introducing PvD-aware host vs. PvD-aware node)

      Section 3.4.3 renamed from "interconnection shared by node" to
      'connection shared by node"

      Section 3.4 renamed into "PvD-aware Host Behavior"

      Added a section "Non-PvD-aware Host Behavior"

A.7.  WG Document version 04

      Updated reference for DHCPv6-PD from RFC 3633 to RFC 8415.

      Enhanced IANA considerations to clarify review process and new
      registries.

      Added a section on considerations for handling DNS on a PvD-aware
      host.
